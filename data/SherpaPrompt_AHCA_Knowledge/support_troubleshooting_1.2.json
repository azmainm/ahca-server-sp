Retrieval brings irrelevant or missing context\nSymptoms\n- Extra noise or absent key passages\n  Likely causes\n- Poor tagging, mis-scoped search, outdated index\n  Quick checks\n- Review included files and tags for the project\n- Inspect retrieval hits for the prompt objective\n  Resolution\n\n1. Tighten objective wording and constraints.\n2. Add or adjust tags and include only authoritative sources.\n3. Rebuild the index for updated files.\n   Verification\n- Re-generate the same draft and spot check citations.\n\nB. File access errors from storage providers\nSymptoms\n- Cannot read certain files or folders\n  Likely causes\n- Permission changes, moved folders, expired tokens\n  Quick checks\n- Confirm user access at the provider\n- Check connector auth status\n  Resolution\n\n1. Re-authenticate and request the smallest necessary scopes.\n2. Update folder paths or relink moved content.\n3. Retry with a single authoritative file to validate access.\n   Verification\n- Successfully retrieve snippets from the target file.\n\nC. Output violates constraints\nSymptoms\n- Over length, wrong format, missing compliance phrases\n  Likely causes\n- Conflicting constraints, weak enforcement in prompt\n  Quick checks\n- Review constraints for specificity and conflicts\n  Resolution\n\n1. Convert constraints to explicit, testable checks in the prompt.\n2. Place constraints before content instructions.\n3. Add a final validation step instructing the model to verify constraints.\n   Verification\n- Re-run with a short sample and confirm compliance.\n\n---",
