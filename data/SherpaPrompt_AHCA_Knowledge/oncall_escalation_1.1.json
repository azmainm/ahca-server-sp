      "raw_markdown": "Purpose\nEnsure after-hours emergencies are transferred immediately to a human with a tested backup and auditable trail.\n\nScope\nCalls that the agent classifies as Emergency after intent detection and caller confirmation.\n\nDefinitions\nEmergency intent: language indicating immediate risk, safety concern, or time-sensitive service impact.\nWarm transfer: live handoff to a human where the agent stays on the line until connected or timeout.\n\nPolicy\n1. Detect emergency intent using configured keywords plus a confirmation step: â€œDo you want me to connect you to our on-call person now?â€\n2. Primary transfer target: Dougâ€™s Business number [MASKED].\n3. If not answered within 20 seconds or call fails, fail over to Dougâ€™s personal cell [MASKED].\n4. If both fail, send a failover SMS to the caller with a callback link and send a summary email to the shared mailbox.\n5. Log: call_id, timestamps, targets attempted, dispositions, and final outcome.\n\nConfiguration\nâ€¢ Transfer timeout: 20 seconds\nâ€¢ Attempts per destination: 1\nâ€¢ Failover notifications: SMS to caller, plus summary email to shared mailbox\nâ€¢ Sensitive data: On-call roster stored privately; the agent reads only status flags, not raw numbers\n\nOperational Notes\nâ€¢ Treat emergency as Sev 1: escalate first, document second.\nâ€¢ Any change to targets or timeout must be followed by a quick simulation before going live.\n\nTest Script (Product-aligned)\nSimulation A: â€œUrgent service issue and I need immediate help.â€\nExpected: immediate warm transfer to Dougâ€™s Business number; if not answered in 20 seconds, fail over to personal cell; summary email recorded; call log includes timestamps and dispositions.\nSimulation B: Force a controlled failure on the primary (reject call). \nExpected: failover occurs; SMS with callback link sent; evidence bundle includes message_id for SMS and summary email, plus call_id and attempt order.\n\nEvidence Bundle (for audits)\nâ€¢ call_id, transfer attempt order, durations\nâ€¢ SMS delivery result and message_id\nâ€¢ Summary email message_id\nâ€¢ Final disposition\n\nDisclosure\nBefore initiating a transfer, the agent includes the greeting disclosure: \"This call may be recorded for training and quality assurance.\"\n\nTiming and Attempts Assertions (QA)\n- Primary transfer attempt rings for 20 seconds (±2s).\n- If needed, secondary transfer attempt rings for 20 seconds (±2s).\n- Exactly one attempt per destination is made per call.\n\nEvidence Fields (for audits and metrics)\n- call_id; timestamps (attempt start/end); transfer attempt order; targets attempted; final disposition (outcome_code)\n- message_id for any SMS callback sent\n- message_id for summary email to the shared mailbox\n- correlation fields if available: request_id from telephony or messaging provider\n"
