          "question": "What's the difference between wood and vinyl fencing?",
          "answer": "Wood fencing offers natural beauty and is initially less expensive but requires regular maintenance (staining/sealing every 2-3 years). Vinyl fencing costs more upfront but is virtually maintenance-free and comes with a 25-year warranty.",

        },
        {
          "question": "How do you determine property lines?",
          "answer": "We recommend having a property survey done before installation. We can work with your surveyor or recommend trusted local surveyors. Installing on property lines requires neighbor agreement. We can install fences 1-2 feet inside your property line to avoid disputes.",
          "category": "Property Lines"
        },
        {
          "question": "What maintenance does my fence need?",
          "answer": "Wood fences need staining or sealing every 2-3 years. Vinyl and aluminum need only occasional washing. Chain link may need rust touch-ups. All fences benefit from annual inspections to check for loose hardware or damage.",
          "category": "Maintenance"
        },
        {
          "question": "Can you match an existing fence style?",
