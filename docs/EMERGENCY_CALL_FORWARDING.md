# Emergency Call Forwarding - Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document explains how the emergency call forwarding feature works for Superior Fencing (and other businesses). When a caller presses the pound key (#) during a call, the system automatically transfers them to a designated emergency contact number.

## How It Works

### 1. Detection
The system detects emergency triggers in multiple ways:
- **Pound Key (#)**: When caller presses # during the call
- **Emergency Keywords**: "emergency", "urgent", "time-sensitive", "asap", "right away", "immediately"

### 2. Call Transfer Flow

```
1. Caller presses # or says emergency keyword
   ‚Üì
2. EmergencyCallHandler.isEmergencyCall() detects the trigger
   ‚Üì
3. ConversationFlowHandler recognizes emergency and calls handleEmergencyCall()
   ‚Üì
4. EmergencyCallHandler retrieves business config and emergency phone number
   ‚Üì
5. Twilio REST API redirects the active call to /twilio/voice/transfer-emergency endpoint
   ‚Üì
6. TwiML endpoint returns <Dial> command with emergency phone number
   ‚Üì
7. Call is transferred to the emergency contact
```

### 3. Architecture Components

#### A. Detection Layer
**File**: `features/voice-agent/services/integrations/EmergencyCallHandler.js`
- Detects emergency triggers in user input
- Manages Twilio REST API client for call redirection
- Logs emergency calls for tracking

#### B. Conversation Handler
**File**: `features/voice-agent/services/conversation/ConversationFlowHandler.js`
- Checks for emergencies before processing regular conversation flow
- Retrieves callSid from RealtimeWebSocketService
- Passes necessary data to EmergencyCallHandler

#### C. Call Transfer Endpoint
**File**: `features/voice-agent/routes/twilio-voice.js`
- **Endpoint**: `POST /twilio/voice/transfer-emergency`
- Returns TwiML with `<Dial>` verb to transfer call
- Validates business configuration and emergency phone number
- Provides fallback messages if transfer fails

#### D. Business Configuration
**File**: `configs/businesses/superior-fencing/config.json`
```json
{
  "companyInfo": {
    "emergencyContact": {
      "available": true,
      "phone": "+15035501817",
      "instructions": "Press # for emergency or time-sensitive issues",
      "note": "TODO: Replace with actual Superior Fencing emergency contact number"
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration Setup

### Step 1: Configure Emergency Phone Number

Edit your business config file: `configs/businesses/[business-id]/config.json`

```json
{
  "companyInfo": {
    "emergencyContact": {
      "available": true,
      "phone": "+1234567890",  // ‚ö†Ô∏è REPLACE WITH ACTUAL EMERGENCY NUMBER
      "instructions": "Press # for emergency or time-sensitive issues"
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Environment Variables

Ensure these Twilio environment variables are set:

```bash
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token
BASE_URL=https://your-server.com  # Or NGROK_URL for development
```

### Step 3: Test the Feature

1. **Call your Twilio number**
2. **Wait for Mason to answer**
3. **Press the pound key (#)** on your phone
4. **Verify**: You should hear "Connecting you with our on-call team now. Please hold."
5. **Confirm**: Call should transfer to the configured emergency number

## For Superior Fencing

### Current Status

‚úÖ **Implemented**:
- Emergency detection (# key and keywords)
- Call transfer logic
- TwiML endpoint for transfers
- Integration with conversation flow
- Error handling and fallback messages

‚ö†Ô∏è **Action Required**:

1. **Update Emergency Phone Number**
   - Current: `+15035501817` (placeholder)
   - File: `configs/businesses/superior-fencing/config.json`
   - Update line 58 with actual Superior Fencing emergency contact number

2. **Test the Feature**
   - Call the Superior Fencing line
   - Press # during the call
   - Verify transfer works correctly

3. **Update Greeting (Optional)**
   - Current greeting already mentions: "If this is an emergency or time-sensitive, please press the pound key now to reach our on-call team."
   - No changes needed unless you want different wording

## Technical Details

### Twilio REST API Call Redirection

When emergency is detected, the system uses Twilio's REST API to redirect the active call:

```javascript
await twilioClient.calls(callSid).update({
  url: `${baseUrl}/twilio/voice/transfer-emergency?businessId=${businessId}`,
  method: 'POST'
});
```

This causes Twilio to request new TwiML from our transfer endpoint.

### Transfer Endpoint TwiML Response

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
  <Say>Connecting you with our on-call team now. Please hold.</Say>
  <Dial callerId="+15035484387">+1234567890</Dial>
  <Say>Sorry, we were unable to connect you. Please hang up and call our emergency line directly.</Say>
  <Hangup/>
</Response>
```

### Error Handling

The system handles multiple failure scenarios:

1. **No Emergency Phone Configured**: Returns message asking caller to call during business hours
2. **Twilio Client Not Initialized**: Logs warning but still provides verbal response
3. **Call Transfer Fails**: Provides fallback message with instructions
4. **Business Not Found**: Returns error message and hangs up

## Logging and Monitoring

Emergency calls are logged with the following information:

```javascript
{
  timestamp: "2024-10-28T...",
  type: "EMERGENCY_CALL",
  businessId: "superior-fencing",
  sessionId: "twilio-CAxxxx...",
  trigger: "#",  // or emergency keyword
  status: "ROUTED"
}
```

Look for these log entries to monitor emergency call activity:
- `üö® [EmergencyHandler] Emergency detected: # pressed`
- `üö® [ConversationFlowHandler] Emergency call detected`
- `‚úÖ [EmergencyHandler] Call redirected to emergency`

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Emergency phone number configured in config.json
- [ ] Environment variables set (TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN, BASE_URL)
- [ ] Test call: Press # during conversation
- [ ] Verify: Hear transfer message
- [ ] Confirm: Call connects to emergency number
- [ ] Test fallback: Try with invalid emergency number configured
- [ ] Check logs: Verify emergency calls are logged correctly

## Troubleshooting

### Call doesn't transfer when pressing #

1. Check if # is being detected:
   - Look for log: `üö® [EmergencyHandler] Emergency detected: # pressed`
   
2. Verify emergency phone is configured:
   ```bash
   # Check config file
   cat configs/businesses/superior-fencing/config.json | grep -A 5 emergencyContact
   ```

3. Check Twilio credentials:
   ```bash
   echo $TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID
   echo $TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN
   ```

### Call transfers but doesn't connect

1. Verify emergency phone number format (E.164):
   - Correct: `+15035501817`
   - Incorrect: `503-550-1817`, `15035501817`

2. Check if the emergency number can receive calls

3. Review Twilio call logs in Twilio Console

### Transfer endpoint not found

1. Verify BASE_URL or NGROK_URL is set correctly
2. Check server logs for endpoint registration
3. Test endpoint manually: `curl -X POST https://your-server.com/twilio/voice/transfer-emergency?businessId=superior-fencing`

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:

1. **Database Logging**: Store emergency calls in database for analytics
2. **SMS Notifications**: Send SMS to admin when emergency is triggered
3. **Call Recording**: Automatically record emergency calls
4. **Multiple Emergency Contacts**: Support fallback numbers if primary is unavailable
5. **Business Hours Awareness**: Different emergency numbers for different times
6. **Caller ID Preservation**: Ensure emergency recipient sees original caller ID
