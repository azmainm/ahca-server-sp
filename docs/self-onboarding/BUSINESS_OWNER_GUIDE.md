# Business Owner's Guide to Self-Service Voice Agent Setup

## 🎯 What This Platform Does

**In Simple Terms:**  
This is a website where you can set up your own AI-powered phone assistant in about 20 minutes - no technical knowledge needed. Your customers will call a phone number, talk to an AI assistant that sounds natural, and you'll get all their information via email.

**Just like how Superior Fence & Construction has Mason answering their calls, you'll have your own AI assistant with your business's personality!**

assistant. If this is an emergency or time-sensitive, please press
the pound key now to reach our on-call team. Parts of this call
may be recorded so we can better understand your needs and improve

### "What if a customer asks something my AI doesn't know?"

Your AI will say:
> "That's a great question! I don't have that specific information right now, but I'll make sure our team follows up with you about that. Is there anything else I can help you with?"

Then in the email summary you get, it will note what the customer asked so you can follow up.

### "Can I use my existing business phone number?"

**Two options:**

**Option 1 (Recommended):** Keep your existing number and forward after-hours calls
- Example: Forward to your AI agent number after 6 PM

- More complicated but possible

You set this up in Step 4! When a customer:
- Presses the # key, OR
